Remember to take your time and work through each question diligently! Test your code, make sure it works, and try to find ways to improve. Once you are happy and satisfied with your code, upload it to Github, then turn in your Github link at the bottom of the page!

Don't forget. Make sure this assignment is in it's own repository. Not mixed in with others!

1. Formatting and Lists with Recipes
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to explore and practice using text formatting tags and creating lists in HTML, inspired by real-world examples from Recipes.

Task 1: Creating Lists Create a recipe for "Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies" with a header and a short paragraph description. Then, add the ingredients into an unordered list and the steps into an ordered list. You can use the following information:

Ingredients:

1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
3/4 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 large eggs
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup chopped nuts (optional)
Steps:

Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until light and fluffy.
Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.
Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the dough.
Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.
Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.
